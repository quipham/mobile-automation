## Running the test
- This build is config to running only on MAC because of directory absolute path and Android SDK setup with brew
- Make sure you have connected device (Check by "adb devices" command)
- Due to no Test APK so the Android Driver Init by the other way, It may lead to Test failure due to device specific (Recommend use SAMSUNG phone and non root device)
- Execute Maven Command
```
mvn clean test
```
Note:
- If maven can't build project and run the test the issue maybe in `setting.xml` file on your local `m2repository`. You can run directly by TestNG with file `BasicInteraction.xml` on package `src/test/java/com/example/booking/xml` (right click on this file to open menu> click on RUN)


## Viewing Test report
- Open file `*/reports/{DateTimeExecute}.html` on any browser
